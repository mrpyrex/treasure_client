          <h3>History</h3>
          Treasure House (Eket Mega Parish) which is today the Provincial
          Headquarters of Akwa Ibom Province 2 in the Redeemed Christian Church
          of God (RCCG) can be traced to 3rd May 2000, when the then Zonal/Area
          Pastor of Eket Zone 1, Pastor Ibanga Udoinyang by the leading of the
          Holy Spirit announced the creation of six new parishes amongst which
          was Treasure House. Located at Km3 along the busy Eket â€“ Oron Road,
          the first service of the new parish was held on 10th May 2000, in the
          auditorium which at that time was an abandoned warehouse building,
          without a roof and rented for a period of two years. The only
          advantages of the warehouse were its sheer size and attractive
          location. Nobody knew that God had plans to make it His habitation
          forever. With fervent prayers God granted the church favour to acquire
          the premises on a permanent basis and the completed air conditioned
          auditorium which now houses the Redeemers Academy was commissioned by
          our Father in the Lord, the General Overseer (worldwide) of RCCG
          Pastor Enoch Adejare Adeboye on 13th May 2004. As a special provincial
          project, Treasure House enjoyed the direct and close guidance of the
          then Provincial Pastor, Pastor Emmanuel Bassey. The Church has also
          been blessed with a long list of carefully selected and gifted men of
          God who have served as Pastors in the parish, such as then Deacon P.
          Gbenga Oyodere, Pastor Mike Ayabonde, Pastor Ibanga Udoinyang, Deacon
          Ernest Essim, Pastor Paul O. Adeyemi, Pastor Godwin Ukwat, Pastor Wale
          Ogunsola, Pastor Enobong Abraham, Pastor Brown Ashegbare and the
          incumbent Pastor Michael Folorunsho. The above mentioned seasoned
          administrators had one vision in common which is to build a big city
          church where all calibers of people in the society can worship God in
          comfort. From the humble beginning 17 years ago, the Lord has turned
          Treasure House from tenants to landlords, with the construction of the
          permanent church auditorium at an advanced stage. As a church we have
          witnessed Gods mighty hand in healings, deliverances, testimonies,
          multiplication in numbers, divine upliftment/repositioning of members
          and marriages all to the Glory of God. Other areas of growth include
          fully automated administrative unit, welfare support, educational
          sponsorship, planting of viable parishes, missionary activities;
          highlighted with the planting of RCCG, Treasure House, Canada, and
          other model parishes. The high point of these achievements came in
          2007, when RCCG Akwa Ibom Province 2 was created with Treasure House
          as its headquarters.
